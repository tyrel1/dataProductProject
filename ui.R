          4, 6, and 8, I limited the choice using radio buttons.  For the weight,
          reactive() is used to convert the user input weight into the units 
          used by the model, lb/1000.  Finally, a pre-set function using the 
          linear model is used to predict the mpg based on the three variables 
          input by the user.')   )
